# Pollen & Pollution Forecast App

## Description

As a team, we have created an application aimed at people with allergies who would want to check the daily pollen and air quality levels.
Our landing page has a search bar under the nav-bar for you to input your chosen city. Once the search has been sent, daily data will be returned to let you know specific levels, and whether they're hig or low overall.

We have further pages in the application explaining the data in detail. These are in the form of a chart. You can see exactly what the scientific figures mean.

### Usage
Enter a city into the search bar, click search button, data retrieved and dislpayed in named sections, research returned figures further by going to the relevant 2chart page.
